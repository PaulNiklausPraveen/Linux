The Linux booting process involves several key stages. Here's a brief overview:

1. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**:
   - The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) initializes hardware components and performs a Power-On Self Test (POST).
   - It then locates and loads the bootloader from the Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT).

2. **Bootloader (GRUB)**:
   - The Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) is loaded. It presents a menu to select the operating system or kernel version.
   - GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control to it.

3. **Kernel Initialization**:
   - The kernel initializes and configures the system hardware.
   - It mounts the root filesystem and starts the `init` process (or `systemd` in modern systems).

4. **Init/Systemd**:
   - The `init` process (or `systemd`) is the first process started by the kernel. It has a process ID (PID) of 1.
   - It initializes system services and sets the system runlevel or target.

5. **Runlevel/Target Initialization**:
   - The system enters the specified runlevel or target, starting necessary services and daemons.
   - The system eventually reaches a state where users can log in.

6. **User Space**:
   - The system is fully operational, and users can interact with it through a login prompt or graphical interface.
